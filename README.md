# GreatCircle

`great-circle` is a simple gem that provides a set of classes to make the manipulation of latitudes, longitudes,
headings, and distances straightforward.  It started life as a fork of the latitude-gem, but has changed so much
that I have decide to turn it into its own Gem.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'great-circle'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install great-circle

## Usage

### Angle



### Latitude and Longitude

Note that coordinates are positive for N/E and negative for S/W.

### Coordinate
